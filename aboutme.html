        <article>My name is Ethan Neuhoff. I played soccer most of my life up until highschool, when 
        I quit and started playing basketball and volleyball. I've been involved with Santana's 
        PLTW program since freshman year, and I plan to continue in it for the rest of my time 
        at Santana.</article>
