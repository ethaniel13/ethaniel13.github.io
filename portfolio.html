    <h2 id="1.1.1"><i>1.1.1</i>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p>   In Hal Abelson’s, Ken Ledeen’s, and Harry Lewis’ Blown to Bits the authors return<br>to the topic of computer changing society many times not only to emphasize their<br>opinion but to draw attention to the facts behind what computing does.<br>All information, monitoring, and data that is done through computing is never truly<br>private, and this is shown through an anecdote in Blown to Bits that talks of a<br>governor that got caught involved with prostitution simply through a monitoring<br>system in his bank that was built to combat organized crime and terrorism. While<br>this proves that computing isn’t perfect, it does show that it has potential to<br>create a huge impact in crime fighting and monitoring in the future. There is<br>already so much information being sent through various computing platforms in the<br>present, that there is no question that computing will continue to transform<br>society in the future.</p>

    <h2 id="1.1.2"><i>1.1.2</i> Lightbot Reflection</h2>
    <p>	  Given the chance to explore the program Lightbot, I was able to see many similarities<br>between Lightbot and a computer; such as a computer runs off a series of inputs and<br>actions. While a computer has many more complex actions, it has the same general<br>concept as the simple program and many of the same purposes. A computer is<br>designed to run off commands just as lightbot does, however, lightbot is purely software<br>and doesn’t have the power of a computer’s hardware. Computers also have the ability to<br>self correct at some points where lightbot is programmed to be corrected by the user.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion Questions</h2>
          <p>1.)   Writing code in small pieces is helpful because it allows the coder to evaluate bugs one line<br>at a time rather than the entire program. This helps to save time and limit future<br>errors.</p>
          <br>
          <p>2.)   Solving equations or rewriting a thesis that won’t match a prompt forces you to apply your<br>problem solving skills that can only be taught through experience.</p>
          <br>
          <p>4.)   A dual core processor can make it appear that it is running many more programs through a process<br>called fast task switching. This process will cause the computer to go through and<br>complete a small part of a task then move on to the next, then repeating the process. This<br>makes it appear that it’s completing more things at once than is really happening.</p>

            <p>1.)   Having only one sprite respond to one command would be helpful to reduce the risk of the<br>program having errors and helps with organization.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2.)   I believe events are things caused by commands and handlers help sort commands to the events.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4.)    a.) The playG() method allows the handler to play sounds over the costumes, the handler<br>chooses how and when the sounds are played.<br>
	                  b.)Having the times and coding behind connecting the sounds to the playG() method would<br>allow more customizability for each sound.</p>

	       <p>1.)  You can use the variable in multiple places for different functions without changing each value individually, this will save time and reduce errors.</p>
	       <br>
	        <pre>2.)   If recentGame=win
	   Then set most recent to win
      Else If recentgame=loss
           Set most recent to loss
            </pre>
	       <br>
	       <p>3.)   a.) In many video games an accumulator may be used to keep track of a score in the game, or an<br>accumulator can be used in tracking minutes on a cell phone.
	                b.) In tracking cell phone minutes, the software adds to the total as time goes by. This makes<br>it an accumulator because of its ability to count without keeping track of when.</p>
	       <br>
	       <p>4.)  An accumulator keeps track of the total inputs, where an aggregator keeps track of specific inputs but not the total.</p>

        <p>Duck quest is a game based around a man who lost his duck in a dungeon and now must go and<br>find it by looking through the rooms of the dungeon to see where his duck went. This program<br>was designed using scratch, and the video illustrates the use of our “doors.” Each “door”<br>is a separate sprite that will be hidden on any room that the door would not be on. When the<br>player character comes in contact with a door sprite the sprite broadcasts the command for the<br>room it is assigned and it loads into the next area.</p>
	  
	  
	  <h2 id="1.2.2">1.2.2 Reflection</h2>
	      <p>The MIT app inventor uses the same principle of block coding that Scratch utilizes in which<br>the scripts will be represented by blocks that provide a more simple explanation.</p>
	  <br>
	      <p>The opportunity to program one’s own device will affect society by creating a more personalized<br>experience one will have with their device, given they understand how to program it. This<br>will allow for a broader use of mobile devices by vastly expanding their capabilities to<br>support the needs of their user.</p>
      <br>
      
      
      
      <h2 id="1.2.3">1.2.3 Reflection</h2>
          <p>MIT App Inventor utilizes the same format as Scratch to code and is similar in simplicity.</p>
      <br>
          <p>Designing applications for a mobile phone allows for a broader range of functions to be<br>performed with the many extra features thata a mobile device has; such as: multiple cameras,<br>GPS, and a touch screen.</p>
