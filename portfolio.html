    <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <paragraphs>
    <p>   In Hal Abelson’s, Ken Ledeen’s, and Harry Lewis’ Blown to Bits the authors return<br>to the topic of computer changing society many times not only to emphasize their<br>opinion but to draw attention to the facts behind what computing does.<br>All information, monitoring, and data that is done through computing is never truly<br>private, and this is shown through an anecdote in Blown to Bits that talks of a<br>governor that got caught involved with prostitution simply through a monitoring<br>system in his bank that was built to combat organized crime and terrorism. While<br>this proves that computing isn’t perfect, it does show that it has potential to<br>create a huge impact in crime fighting and monitoring in the future. There is<br>already so much information being sent through various computing platforms in the<br>present, that there is no question that computing will continue to transform<br>society in the future.</p>

    <h2>Lightbot Reflection</h2>
    <paragraphs>
    <p>	  Given the chance to explore the program Lightbot, I was able to see many similarities<br>between Lightbot and a computer; such as a computer runs off a series of inputs and<br>actions. While a computer has many more complex actions, it has the same general<br>concept as the simple program and many of the same purposes. A computer is<br>designed to run off commands just as lightbot does, however, lightbot is purely software<br>and doesn’t have the power of a computer’s hardware. Computers also have the ability to<br>self correct at some points where lightbot is programmed to be corrected by the user.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion Questions</h2>
          <paragraphs>
          <p>1.)   Writing code in small pieces is helpful because it allows the coder to evaluate bugs one line<br>at a time rather than the entire program. This helps to save time and limit future<br>errors.</p>
          <br>
          <p>2.)   Solving equations or rewriting a thesis that won’t match a prompt forces you to apply your<br>problem solving skills that can only be taught through experience.</p>
          <br>
          <p>4.)   A dual core processor can make it appear that it is running many more programs through a process<br>called fast task switching. This process will cause the computer to go through and<br>complete a small part of a task then move on to the next, then repeating the process. This<br>makes it appear that it’s completing more things at once than is really happening.</p>

            <p>1.)   Having only one sprite respond to one command would be helpful to reduce the risk of the<br>program having errors and helps with organization.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2.)   I believe events are things caused by commands and handlers help sort commands to the events.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4.)    a.) The playG() method allows the handler to play sounds over the costumes, the handler<br>chooses how and when the sounds are played.<br>
	                  b.)Having the times and coding behind connecting the sounds to the playG() method would<br>allow more customizability for each sound.</p>

	   <paragraphs>
	       <p>1.)  You can use the variable in multiple places for different functions without changing each value individually, this will save time and reduce errors.</p>
	       <br>
	        <pre>2.)   If recentGame=win
	   Then set most recent to win
      Else If recentgame=loss
           Set most recent to loss
            </pre>
	       <br>
	       <p>3.)   a.) In many video games an accumulator may be used to keep track of a score in the game, or an accumulator can be used in tracking minutes on a cell phone.
	                b.)In tracking cell phone minutes, the software adds to the total as time goes by. This makes it an accumulator because of its ability to count without keeping track of when.</p>
	       <br>
	       <p>4.)  An accumulator keeps track of the total inputs, where an aggregator keeps track of specific inputs but not the total.</p>
