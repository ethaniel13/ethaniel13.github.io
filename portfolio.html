    <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In Hal Abelson’s, Ken Ledeen’s, and Harry Lewis’ Blown to Bits the authors return<br>to the topic of computer changing society many times not only to emphasize their<br>opinion but to draw attention to the facts behind what computing does.<br>All information, monitoring, and data that is done through computing is never truly<br>private, and this is shown through an anecdote in Blown to Bits that talks of a<br>governor that got caught involved with prostitution simply through a monitoring<br>system in his bank that was built to combat organized crime and terrorism. While<br>this proves that computing isn’t perfect, it does show that it has potential to<br>create a huge impact in crime fighting and monitoring in the future. There is<br>already so much information being sent through various computing platforms in the<br>present, that there is no question that computing will continue to transform<br>society in the future.</p>
