    <h2>Blown to Bits Reflection</h2>
    <p>In Hal Abelson’s, Ken Ledeen’s, and Harry Lewis’ Blown to Bits the authors return<br>to the topic of computer changing society many times not only to emphasize their<br>opinion but to draw attention to the facts behind what computing does.<br>All information, monitoring, and data that is done through computing is never truly<br>private, and this is shown through an anecdote in Blown to Bits that talks of a<br>governor that got caught involved with prostitution simply through a monitoring<br>system in his bank that was built to combat organized crime and terrorism. While<br>this proves that computing isn’t perfect, it does show that it has potential to<br>create a huge impact in crime fighting and monitoring in the future. There is<br>already so much information being sent through various computing platforms in the<br>present, that there is no question that computing will continue to transform<br>society in the future.</p>

    <h2>Lightbot Reflection</h2>
    <p>	Given the chance to explore the program Lightbot, I was able to see many similarities<br>between Lightbot and a computer; such as a computer runs off a series of inputs and<br>actions. While a computer has many more complex actions, it has the same general<br>concept as the simple program and many of the same purposes. A computer is<br>designed to run off commands just as lightbot does, however, lightbot is purely software<br>and doesn’t have the power of a computer’s hardware. Computers also have the ability to<br>self correct at some points where lightbot is programmed to be corrected by the user.</p>
