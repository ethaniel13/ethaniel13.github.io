    <p>In Hal Abelson’s, Ken Ledeen’s, and Harry Lewis’ Blown to Bits the authors return to the topic of computer changing society many times not only to emphasize their opinion but to draw attention to the facts behind what computing does. All information, monitoring, and data that is done through computing is never truly private, and this is shown through an anecdote in Blown to Bits that talks of a governor that got caught involved with prostitution simply through a monitoring system in his bank that was built to combat organized crime and terrorism. While this proves that computing isn’t perfect, it does show that it has potential to create a huge impact in crime fighting and monitoring in the future. There is already so much information being sent through various computing platforms in the present, that there is no question that computing will continue to transform society in the future.</p>
